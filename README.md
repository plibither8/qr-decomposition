# QR Decomposition by Gram-Schmidt Process

## The Problem

Write a program in either **Python** or **Julia** to find the QR factorization of an _`m×n`_ matrix. The program should take both _`m`_ and _`n`_, as well as the entries of the matrix _`A`_, as inputs.

The output of the program should be an _`m×n`_ matrix _`Q`_ and an _`n×n`_ matrix _`R`_ such that _`A = QR`_. _`Q`_ should be a matrix which has the property that _`Q'Q = I`_ and _`R`_ should be triangular.
